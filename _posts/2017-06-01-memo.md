#### To-dos today
- Boris found errors in LINbase:
  - LINgroup description only describes 0, which is the first digit.
  - Shows multiple descriptions to the same single LINgroup, which we don't need.
  - Align LINgroups by hierarchy
  - Add nav bar to every page.
- Search by "All" is not up yet.
- Also I noticed that search by LINgroup description isn't functioning properly.
- Avail "keyword" searching in SQL.
- Add "Family" to Description_Items
- Change "Nickname" to "Non-taxonomic group"
- While LINgroup description, user has to describe at least one of "family", "genus", "species", "Non-taxonomic group" before getting to comment or add url.
