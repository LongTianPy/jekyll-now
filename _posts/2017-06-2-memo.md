#### To-dos today
- Boris found errors in LINbase:
  - LINgroup description only describes 0, which is the first digit.
  - Shows multiple descriptions to the same single LINgroup, which we don't need.
  - Align LINgroups by hierarchy
  - Add nav bar to every page.
- ~~Search by "All" is not up yet.~~ Done @ 6/2/2017
- ~~Also I noticed that search by LINgroup description isn't functioning properly.~~ Done @ 6/2/2017
- ~~Avail "keyword" searching in SQL.~~ Done, and is now case-insensitive @ 6/2/2017
- ~~Add "Family" to Description_Items~~ Done today
