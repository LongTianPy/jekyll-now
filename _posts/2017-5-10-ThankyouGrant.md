title: Thank you, Grant! And welcome Karan! Notes for meeting @ 05/10/2017
---

Grant is leaving for his brand new start soon! Thanks a lot, it's been great experience working with you!

Karan will be helping us with the development of the LINbase website, hope you will enjoy it!

** Notes:
*** Grant, Karan and I will meet tomorrow (Thursday) morning, mainly introducing LINbase to Karan at the technical level.
*** I will take care about the result pages, since sometimes the table has tens of rows and the footer will be floating 
in the middle of the page. Also the column checkboxes will be all the way top in this case. So I will look into the 
table and make a scroll inside the table, so that the column checkboxes are fixed and will always show.
*** As I put down in (https://github.com/LongTianPy/LIN_proto/issues/1), keep it in mind that we are going to take care
 of the privacy issues.
*** Trying to load genomes from NCBI RefSeq database.
**** Dont forget to double check the file comparison function. Make sure it works!
