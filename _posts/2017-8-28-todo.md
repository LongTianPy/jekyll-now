#### Things to do after meeting
##### last update: 9/5/2017
- ~~For adding LINgroup descriptions, tax- or non-taxonomic group is first class,
and comments, urls are associated to that class (always show up).~~ There might be multiple comments
and urls for the same LINgroup, make it possible for display.
- ~~Add "All" in LINgroup search~~
- ~~Go to fix search pages if nothing can be found.~~
- Update LINgroup after LIN's assigned
- Make profile page more powerful, so he/she can see what's been submitted, genomes or LINgroups,
and, edit them, and set it private or public.
- Add email link to LINgruop profile page at who described it.
- ~~Relocate BLAST database to /home directory~~
